## Performance

DashMap is included in a set of benchmarks found [here](https://git.nebulanet.cc/Acrimon/conc-map-bench)
that use [bustle](https://docs.rs/bustle/0.3.2/bustle), a port of the libcuckoo benchmark harness.
Benchmarks are a best effort and we try to make them as unbiased and realistic as possible. Contributions are accepted there too!
